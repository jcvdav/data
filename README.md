# Data

This repo summarizes a few sources of data. I use one github repo for each data set because this simplifies maintaining each of them. This repo only contains the submodules that point at the main branch on the source repo.

# Available data within each data set:

## `mex_fisheries`

- VMS-derived vessel tracking data (2008 - 2022)
- Vessel registry
- Ladnings data (2000 - 2018/2019)
- Fishing permits
- Select concesion polygons

## `remotes`
- monthly Sea Surface Temperature (~1km X 1km; 2003 - 2022)
- CHL-a (coming soon)
- Kelp cover (coming soon)

## `human_pop` (coming soon)
- Georeferenced population data for Mexico (and neighbouring countries)
- Human gravity index along the coastline

## `ram_boundaries` (coming soon)
- Chris Free's RAM boundaries, unified into a single geopackage
